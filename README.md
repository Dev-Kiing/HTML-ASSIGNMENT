My Daily Journal
Today started with a beautiful sunrise that painted the sky orange and pink.

I had a cup of tea while planning my day.

Learning HTML has been an exciting journey so far.

I love how structured and simple the code feels.

My goal is to become a full-stack developer in the near future.

After breakfast, I worked on a few GitHub assignments.

Using version control is becoming easier with practice.

In the afternoon, I went for a walk to refresh my mind.

Later, I watched a short tech documentary on web development.

Finally, I wrapped up the day by writing this journal entry.

Hereâ€™s a photo I like:
