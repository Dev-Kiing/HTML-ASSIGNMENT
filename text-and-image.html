  <h1>My Daily Journal</h1>

  <p>Today started with a beautiful sunrise that painted the sky orange and pink.</p>
  <p>I had a cup of tea while planning my day.</p>
  <p>Learning HTML has been an exciting journey so far.</p>
  <p>I love how structured and simple the code feels.</p>
  <p>My goal is to become a full-stack developer in the near future.</p>
  <p>After breakfast, I worked on a few GitHub assignments.</p>
  <p>Using version control is becoming easier with practice.</p>
  <p>In the afternoon, I went for a walk to refresh my mind.</p>
  <p>Later, I watched a short tech documentary on web development.</p>
  <p>Finally, I wrapped up the day by writing this journal entry.</p>
